# Lab 3: Paint it Black

This lab is about getting experienc using functional decomposition to approach coding problems and using various control statements.

It is also our first pair programming lab, so look to the front of the room for your partner for the day and where you should be sitting! And be prepared to switch who is typing every 6-7 minutes!

You don't need to upload your final solution back to Github, though you should ensure both partners have a copy of the final checked off version.
